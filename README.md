Project Euler Solutions in R

Hi. These are a few examples which show my ability to code and the sort of stuff I like to code. 
They are solutions to questions taken from the website 'https://projecteuler.net' under the section named 'archives'. I have written them in R.
I expect to be updating this repository periodically as I improve upon my existing solutions and add additional ones.
