Project Euler Solutions in R

Hi. These are a few examples which show my ability to code and the sort of stuff I like to code. 
They are taken from the website 'https://projecteuler.net' under 'archives'. I have written them in R.
This repository should be updated intermittently as I improve upon my existing solutions and complete additional problems.
