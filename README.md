Project Euler Solutions in R

Hi. These are a few examples which show my ability to code and show of what type of stuff I like to code. 
They are taken from the website 'https://projecteuler.net/archives' and I have written them in R.
This repository should be updated intermittently as I improve upon my existing solutions, and complete additional problems.
